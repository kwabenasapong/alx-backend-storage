    """ Familiarize yourself with the INCR command and its python equivalent.

    In this task, we will implement a system to count how many times methods of the Cache class are called.

    Above Cache define a count_calls decorator that takes a single method Callable argument and returns a Callable.

    As a key, use the qualified name of method using the __qualname__ dunder method.

    Create and return function that increments the count for that key every time the method is called and returns the value returned by the original method.

    Remember that the first argument of the wrapped function will be self which is the instance itself, which lets you access the Redis instance.

    Protip: when defining a decorator it is useful to use functool.wraps to conserve the original functionâ€™s name, docstring, etc. Make sure you use it as described here.

    In this task, we will define a call_history decorator to store the history of inputs and outputs for a particular function.

    Everytime the original function will be called, we will add its input parameters to one list in redis, and store its output into another list.

    In call_history, use the decorated functionâ€™s qualified name and append ":inputs" and ":outputs" to create input and output list keys, respectively.

    call_history has a single parameter named method that is a Callable and returns a Callable.

    In the new function that the decorator will return, use rpush to append the input arguments. Remember that Redis can only store strings, bytes and numbers. Therefore, we can simply use str(args) to normalize. We can ignore potential kwargs for now.

    Execute the wrapped function to retrieve the output. Store the output using rpush in the "...:outputs" list, then return the output.

    In this tasks, we will implement a get_page function (prototype: def get_page(url: str) -> str:). The core of the function is very simple. It uses the requests module to obtain the HTML content of a particular URL and returns it.

    Inside get_page track how many times a particular URL was accessed in the key "count:{url}" and cache the result with an expiration time of 10 seconds.

    Tip: Use http://slowwly.robertomurray.co.uk to simulate a slow response and test your caching.

    Bonus: implement this use case with decorators.
